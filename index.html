<h2> What should i do for my future</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        I should be bolder in every situation
    </li>

    <li> I should be aware of my potential</li>

    <li>
        I should be able to do complex things <br/>
        Such as coding, building body muscle, learning new language
    </li>

    <li> I must wake up with a purpose for everyday <br/>
    Not just occasionaly</li>

    <li> I have to remind myself that development is not just being succesful <br/>
    On the contrary, it is the concept of doing wrong and herewith trying constantly</li>

    <li>Last but not least: 
        <ol>  
            <li>Love yourself and appreciate your own apperiance</li>  <br/>
     <li> There is a meaning behind of your living here. You are worthy and be patient with your faults</li>
    </ol>
</li>

       </ul>

    <p> I am sitting on my favorite reading corner, eating some yogurt, banana and oat mixture and learning html right now. <br/> To be honest, that shit is my favorite actually because way more easier than CSS or Javascript. <br/> So we will see what will happen to me but <br/> I can clearly say that my curiousity about programming is beyond that just learning a new skill. <br/>  Maybe I will write down some new cods which humanity will reach out to the Space with them?</p>
</a>

<p>So I will write down my youtube link adress for getting further information about me: <br/>
